# OpenDiary [Web-site]

![.NET Core]()

The main idea of the application is to develop web-based diary (like a blog) to create, read & comment posts. Each new user is invited to create his account and fill out information about himself. Then the user can write their thoughts and share them with other authors. The application also allows users to comment on each other's posts. 

## Getting Started

The application is free-to-use, so just login to start creating amaizing posts!

## Application settings

For the correct deploy, it is necessary to update the [appsettnigs.json](https://github.com/aslamovyura/coffee-meet-telegram-bot/tree/master/src/Bot/appsettings.json) file in the root directory of the web project, filled in according to the template below.
